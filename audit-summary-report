# AWS Security Baseline Audit Summary Report

## 1. Purpose
This report summarizes the security controls implemented in the AWS Security Baseline Project. The goal is to validate that core security, compliance, and governance requirements are met according to AWS best practices and NIST 800-53 controls.

## 2. Scope
The audit covers:
- S3 bucket security configuration
- IAM access controls
- CloudTrail audit logging
- Encryption and data protection
- NIST control mapping
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategy

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1 S3 Security Configuration
- Public access is fully blocked.
- Server-side encryption (AES-256) enabled.
- Versioning enabled to support rollback.
- Access logging enabled and delivered to separate logging bucket.

Status: Compliant

### 3.2 IAM Access Controls
- Least-privilege IAM policy implemented.
- Access restricted to read-only operations on the main S3 bucket.
- No wildcard permissions present.

Status: Compliant

### 3.3 Audit Logging (CloudTrail)
- Multi-region CloudTrail trail created.
- Management events logged across all regions.
- Log file validation enabled.
- Logs delivered to the centralized logging bucket.

Status: Compliant

### 3.4 Encryption Controls
- S3 buckets encrypted using SSE-S3.
- Logging bucket also encrypted.
- No KMS keys required for this baseline.

Status: Compliant

### 3.5 NIST 800-53 Mapping
Controls implemented:
- AC-2, AC-3, AC-6
- AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, AU-9
- SC-13, SC-28
- SI-4
- CM-6, CP-9, MP-4, PL-2

Status: Compliant with baseline applicable controls

### 3.6 Risk Register Review
All identified risks have:
- Defined likelihood and impact
- Clear mitigation recommendations
- Assigned control ownership

No unmitigated critical risks identified.

Status: Low overall risk exposure

## 4. Conclusion
The AWS Security Baseline is fully implemented and properly documented.  
The environment demonstrates strong alignment with AWS security best practices and NIST 800-53 controls.

This project represents a secure, well-documented, auditable cloud configuration suitable for GRC, cloud security, and compliance functions.
